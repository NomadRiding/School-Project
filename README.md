# The Book Club (pending title)

## Introduction

My Psuedo name is NomadRiding, I am working on a book project similar to GoodReads.
For too long, the rating system has been flawed. There is more depth to a book than just a 1-5 rating can relate 

## Classes

Four Classes, Four Interfaces

- The classes created are **User** **Author** **Book** and **Rating**

## How it works.

### User

- A user is created with a name, email, username and password

### Author

- An author is created with a name, short bio and a website

### Book
- A book is created with a title and an ISBN number
- The book is paired with the author based on author Id

### Rating
- Rating is given as an average
- Five subratings are as follows: Plot, Pace, Tone, WorldDevelopment, and Reread.


## Future implementations

There is always room for improvement, and in the future this app I hope to add some new and exciting features

## Users

- Will have the ability to add friends, accept or deny friend requests, add a bio
- add a book to a read pile, to be read, or currently reading
- Users will be able to add books to a favorite collection so friends can see as a recommended

## Authors

- Authors will be able to create accounts to chat and leave answers on reviews
- Authors will be able to have a profile picture. 
- Authors will have an area where they can share their upcoming book progression

## Books

- Books will have a cover page
-
